# This file contains the indexing information for the recipes.
# Lines like this are comments and don't matter.  Otherwise, the lines look like:
#  recipe name:indexvalue1:indexvalue2:...
# When the recipe "recipe name" is encountered (case sensitive, which is probably a bug),
# then cookbookgen.pl will add entries of the form
#  \index{indexvalue1}
#  \index{indexvalue2}
#  etc.
# to the LaTeX file.  See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing#Sophisticated_indexing
