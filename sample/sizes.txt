# This file contains a list of the files whose sizes we might need to override.
#
# This is a comment.  Lines should look like:
#    recipe_filename:sizethatshouldbeused
# where sizethatshouldbeused is the parameter to \includegraphics, preferably
# something that is in terms of \textwidth.
# Unlike tags.txt, here we use the raw filename with the extension stripped
# (for a 2-image recipe, we might need to resize the two files differently).
#
# See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics#Including_graphics
# Notably, keepaspectratio=true will try to fit the image in a box of a given
# width and height!
Extra tall recipe:width=\textwidth,height=1.20\textwidth,keepaspectratio=true
Extra wide recipe:width=\textwidth,height=1.55\textwidth,keepaspectratio=true
